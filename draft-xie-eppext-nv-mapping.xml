      <t>
This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
for the provisioning and management of Name Verification (NV) stored in a shared
central repository in China.  Specified in XML, the mapping defines EPP command 
syntax and semantics as applied to name verification.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
When creating a domain name which will be stored in a shared central
repository, some registry administrative organizations require the 
verification of the domain name and the real name based on legal or policy
requirements.
      </t>
      <t>
The domain name verification, means to verify the domain label is in
compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The real name
verification, means to verify that the registrant really exists and is authorized to register a domain name.			
      </t>
<t>The verification of this document meets the requirements in China, but MAY be applicable outside of China.</t>  
      <t>
In order to meet above requirements of the domain name registration, this document describes the 
Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Name Verification (NV) Mapping. This document is specified 
using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in 
<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20040204"></xref> and XML Schema notation as described in 
<xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028"></xref> and 
<xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028"></xref>. 							
      </t>
      <t>
The EPP core protocol specification <xref target="RFC5730"></xref> provides a complete description 
of EPP command and response structures. A thorough understanding of the base protocol specification 
is necessary to understand the mapping described in this document.  					
      </t>     
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
          "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
          interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
          "nv-1.0" in this document is used as an abbreviation for 
          urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:nv-1.0.
		  The XML namespace prefix "nv" is used, but implementations MUST NOT 
		  depend on it and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser 
		  and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.
      </t>
      <t>     
      	  In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
          represents lines returned by a protocol server. Indentation and white 
          space in examples are provided only to illustrate element relationships
          and are not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.
      </t>
      <t> 
		  XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications 
		  and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the 
		  character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

	  <t>
          The following definitions are used in this document:         
      </t>
      <t>
          <list style="symbols">

            <t>
Domain Name Verification(DNV), represents the verification of the domain's
label is in compliance with laws, rules and regulations.
            </t>
            <t>
Real Name Verification(RNV), represents the verification of the registrant(real name) is in
compliance with laws, rules and regulations.
            </t>     
		             <t>
Name Verification(NV), represents DNV, RNV or both of them.

		      <t>
Verification Service Provider(VSP), collects the proof of materials for Name Verification(NV) and performs the verification.  
            </t>	

<t>
Verification Code, which is described in <xref target="I-D.gould-eppext-verificationcode"/> ,is 
a formatted token, referred to as the Verification Code Token, 
that is digitally signed by a Verification Service Provider (VSP) using XML Signature
in "W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124".
</t>

<t>
Signed Code, which is described in <xref target="I-D.gould-eppext-verificationcode"/>, 
is the XML Signature format of the Verification Code.
</t>	

<t>
Encoded Signed Code,  which is described in <xref target="I-D.gould-eppext-verificationcode"/>, 
is the "base64" encoded XML Signature format of the Verification Code.
</t>		
<t>
Prohibited Name(PN), is a domain label that is prohibited from registration.
</t>
<t>
Restricted Name(RN), is a domain label that is restricted from registration.  Additional 
information is needed during Domain Name Verification(DNV) to authorize the registration of 
a Restricted Name.
</t>	
          </list>          
      </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Object Attributes">
	  <t>
	An EPP NV object has attributes and associated values that can be
   viewed and modified by the sponsoring client or the server.  This
   section describes each attribute type in detail.  The formal syntax
   for the attribute values described here can be found in the "Formal
   Syntax" section of this document and in the appropriate normative
   references.
	  </t>
	  <t>
          <list style="symbols">
		  <t>
   Status Values.
   A NV object MUST always have one associated status
   value. The Status value can be set only by the server. 
   The status value MAY be accompanied by a string
   of human-readable text that describes the rationale for the status
   applied to the object. The status of an object MAY change as a result of
   an action performed by a server operator.
		   Status Value Descriptions:
          <list style="symbols">
		  <t>
		  pendingCompliant.  The object verification is not complete and 
		  is pending completion.  
		  Please refer to <xref target="offlineReview"/> for details on handling offline review of

		  </t>
		  <t>
		  compliant.
		  The object is in compliance with the policy.

		  		  <t>
		  nonCompliant.
		  The object is not in compliance with the policy.
		  </t>
		  </list>    
		  </t>
		  <t>

   Dates and Times.  Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in
   <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028"></xref> MUST be used to represent date-time
   values, as XML Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or
   lower case "T" and "Z" characters.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		  Authorization Information.
   Authorization information is associated with NV objects to
   facilitate query operations.  Authorization information is
   assigned when a NV object is created, and it might be updated in
   the future.  This specification describes password-based
   authorization information, though other mechanisms are possible.

<section title="Name Verification Proofs" anchor="nameVerificationProofs">
<t>
When performing name verification, some Verification Service Providers(VSP) MAY need to collect
the proof of materials to verify the real name of a registrant. The proof of materials is defined 
with the following enumerated values:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
"poc" for Proof of Citizen(POC).  The POC represents the citizen's identification card(ID) material.
</t>

    <section title="EPP Command Mapping">
      <t>      
				A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
  				in the EPP core protocol specification <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>.  
  				The command mappings described here are specifically for use in 
  				provisioning and managing NV via EPP.
      </t>
      <section title="EPP Query Commands">
<t>
   EPP provides three commands to retrieve NV information: &lt;check&gt;
   determine if an object is known to the server, 
   &lt;info&gt; to retrieve detailed information associated with an object, and &lt;transfer&gt; to retrieve object transfer
   status information.
</t>
<section title="EPP &lt;check&gt; Command">
<t>
   The EPP &lt;check&gt; command is used to determine if the domain's label can be
   used to create a DNV object. It provides a hint that allows a
   client to anticipate the success or failure of creating a DNV object
   using the &lt;create&gt; command.
</t>
 <t>
   In addition to the standard EPP command elements, the &lt;check&gt; command
   MUST contain a &lt;nv:check&gt; element that identifies the nv
   namespace. The &lt;nv:check&gt; element contains the following child
   elements:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
One or more &lt;nv:name&gt; elements that contain the domain labels to be queried.
</t>
</list>

   When a &lt;check&gt; command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   &lt;resData&gt; element MUST contain a child &lt;nv:chkData&gt; element that
   identifies the NV namespace.  The &lt;nv:chkData&gt; element
   contains one or more &lt;nv:cd&gt;elements that contain the following

               <t>
A &lt;nv:name&gt; element that contains the queried domain label.  This element MUST contain an "avail"
      attribute whose value indicates object availability (can it be
      created or not) at the moment the &lt;check&gt; command was
      completed.  A value of "1" or "true" means that the object can be
      created.  A value of "0" or "false" means that the object can
      not be created. This element SHOULD contain a "restricted"
      attribute whose value indicates this name is a RN or not, 
	  with a default value of "0".  A value of "1" or "true" 
      means that the object is a RN Name.  A value of "0" or "false" means 
      that the object is not restricted. 
</t>
<t>
An OPTIONAL &lt;nv:reason&gt; element that MAY be provided when an
      object cannot be created.  If present, this element contains
      server-specific text to help explain why the object cannot be
      created.  This text MUST be represented in the response
      language previously negotiated with the client; an OPTIONAL "lang"
      attribute MAY be present to identify the language if the
      negotiated value is something other than the default value of "en"

   depending on the identity of the querying client, and server policy towards unauthorized
   clients.  If the querying client is the sponsoring client, all
   available information MUST be returned. If the querying client is
   not the sponsoring client but the client provides valid authorization
   information, all available information MUST be returned. If the
   querying client is not the sponsoring client and the client does not
   provide valid authorization information, server policy determines
   which OPTIONAL elements are returned.

   Commands are processed by a server in the order they are received
   from a client.  Though an immediate response confirming receipt and
   processing of the command is produced by the server, a server
   operator MAY perform an offline review of requested transform
   commands before completing the requested action.  In such situations,
   the response from the server MUST clearly note that the transform
   command has been received and processed but that the requested action
   is pending.  The status of the corresponding object MUST clearly
   reflect processing of the pending action.  The server MUST notify the
   client when offline processing of the action has been completed.

   Examples describing a &lt;create&gt; command that requires offline review

				EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding 
				information using the Unicode character set and its more compact representations 
				including UTF-8. Conformant XML processors recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16. 
				Though XML includes provisions to identify and use other character encodings 
				through use of an "encoding" attribute in an &lt;?xml?&gt; declaration, 
				use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED.
